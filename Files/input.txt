Dear Mr.Baba,

It is brought to your kind notice that I am having a minor back surgery scheduled on “18/11/2019”. I am planning to rejoin office on “18/12/2019 Noon”. Upon having a successful surgery, I will get rid of the pain that has been inhibiting my movements for many years. All the required paperwork is enclosed with the leave letter. I am working very hard to complete all the projects being assigned to me before going on leave. I am also coordinating with my colleagues to ensure that they take care of my responsibilities in my absence without causing any inconvenience to you.

This surgery will really help me in focusing more on my job and becoming more productive with wow experience. Your consideration Refer this issue is highly appreciated. In case of an emergency, please feel free to contact me on the phone.

Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
Anna
